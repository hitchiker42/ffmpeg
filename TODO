* For now postpone work on the postproc_simd branch
  I don't have time to re-organize the code in the way I want before I need to
  have something done. So just put that off untill the summer (hopefully)
* Check asm code for any rounding errors
  These are most likely due to re-orginization of instructions,
  or the use of different instructions in sse/avx code
* See if processing multiple blocks in parallel is changing the results
  If so email michael and tell him, since there's nothing I can do about that.

  The reason for this is that some filters read from earlier lines for
  interpolation, etc and if blocks are processed linearly those lines have
  already been processed, if blocks are processed in parallel those lines might
  not be processed yet.

  This is something that is inherent to vectorizing the code.

* Make sure that the code I add passes all currently existing tests
  Increasing the test coverage is something I would like to do, but I don't
  need to do it right now, and all my code should have to do is work with the
  current tests.

* Try and clean up the mess of code I added to get simd working
  This is actually not super important, Ideally this code is just going to be
  temporary and so who cares if it's ugly, but cleaning it up should help
  in debugging so it's somewhat important

* Actual TODO list
** See if processisng blocks in parallel causes inherent error and
   if so send an email about it.
** Reorganize my asm code to match the inline asm and possibly elimnate 
   rounding errors.
** Rebase the gsoc_qualification branch 
   Add in some more code from postproc_simd, specifically the code that moves
   the inline asm for packing qp.
** If possible get the gsoc_qualification code to pass tests
   It might not be possible due to the parallel blocks thing mentioned earlier
** Ensure all patches from gsoc_qualificatiaon apply cleanly
   also ensure each patch leaves the code in a working state (i.e passes all tests)
